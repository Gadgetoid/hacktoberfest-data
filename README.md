## Diving in: Pull Requests

Taking a closer look at the pull requests of Hacktoberfest 2019, we can pull out some more interesting insights.
The first thing that can be done is to take a look at how the Hacktobefest-related spam was this year, and more
 importantly how much of it was identified by us, the community and maintainers.

Of the **483,127** PRs submitted during Hacktoberfest, only **23,299 (4.82%)** were identified as spam, with
 **19,587 (84.07%)** of those being in a repository that the Hacktoberfest team excluded from the competition for not
 following the shared values and **3,712 (15.93%)** being labeled as "invalid" by project maintainers.

Thank you to all those in the community who helped us by reporting repositories through the Hacktoberfest website and
 to the maintainers who spent their time reviewing pull requests and labeling spammy ones as "invalid".
